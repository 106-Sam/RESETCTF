flag submitted by _@hack3r_oneness_ , **Captain**

This flag was very simple but when i first looked at this i was quite confused. I thought it is ROT13, by the time i figured it out what it was my teammate already submitted the flag
It was quite simple the text was reversed. I used Cyberchef tool to get the flag, whereas you can do it manually too.
